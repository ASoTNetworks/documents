5. Establish Agenda for Break Out Meeting

# Notes

- Still working on pitching our project, what sounds good today:

> "Community-owned decentralized network ... not just to connect to the internet"
> "Getting out hands dirty and building an alternative"

## Update on Pi Prototypes

- Discussed current status and what a potential implementation would look like:
    - Raspberri Pi's mesh point links ~100m range
    - Physical mesh protocol independent from cjdns overlay
    - Node would have IPv4 and cjdns IPv6
    - Routing and Security still taking up a fair amount of CPU cycles

- Open questions from discussion:
    - What are our targets for performance?
    - What is our current performance?
      `50 Mbps` mesh link; `13 Mbps` pi2; speculating `~30 Mbps` pi3
    - Are the hardware limits we see enough to move away from off the shelf toward custom hardware/solutions?

- Next steps should be laid out in a tech roadmap, moving on to tackling:
    - look at pi3 and ODROID (less interest)
    - range
    - meshing scalability
    - connecting to the internet!

## Clean Up Brainstorm Gdoc

- Spoke about our Key issues and reframed language to focus on the challenges we see in the
[Brainstorm Gdoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XQiqvkuFiTmaVtZcjmwBUfH5cwZdaYYLXHPqWAB1sB0/edit)
- Will focus on using this as a prompt for our breakout meeting


## Establish Agenda for Breakout Meeting

- 3 hour meeting, want time keeping and strong facilitation
- Two key areas to consider:
    - Generating some sort of vision we all agree on from the brainstorming
    - Having a Roadmap (with Outreach and Technical goals)

## Preliminary Roadmap Thoughts

- Maker Festival Proposal **April 30, 2016** [Maker Festival 2016 Call For Makers](http://cfm.makerfestival.ca/ords/f?p=107:1:2821773306655)
    - _"TO mesh mini"_ to demo that is relatable to current problems
    - **consensus** that we emphasize this and put in a proposal, will work on it one of the Civic Tech TO nights

- HOPE
    - treat it as outreach opportunity to other groups in different geographic areas

# Outcomes

- Decided to refine agenda for breakout meeting over the week
    - will chat to confirm agenda prior to beginning of meeting
