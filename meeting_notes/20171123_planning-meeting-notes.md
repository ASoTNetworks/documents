We will use voting in this meeting to reach consensus and help keep to time:
- _Thumbs up_: go ahead, care about the issue and happy with direction
- _Closed fist_: "no-block"
- _Thumbs down_: needs more discussion, feel strongly enough to block

# Notes

## Intros

- dante, interested in solar-powered node, been organizing
- milan, long range links and potential sites
- tristan, campus co-op interested in building ISPs, DDJC work, community-owned infrastructure
- darkdrgn2k
- garry
- ben, interested in hardware/software, thinking about maintenance and monitoring
- dcwalk, outreach

## Recap

### tomesh so far

- Started ~2 years ago, thinking about models for 
- Outreach events around networking literacy workshops, connecting to other groups, building reference hardware and software
- Opportunities around a mesh implementation for internet-sharing
- Public hardware workshops (install parties)
- Working relationship with other mesh orgs in the U.S.
- Revamped website with node map, now think about how to date things and make it look more active?

### Previous planning session

- [Notes from April 24](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/blob/master/meeting_notes/20161112_planning-meeting-notes.md) for reference

### Working Areas and Recent News

1. Tools (benhylau/garry)
    - [Tech Update](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/blob/e7fed3ae3b6c64a3cda2f9308f3234ca7ceaad10/technical/20171122_tomesh-tech-status-update.md) posted, review of design goals
    - discussed the difference between ubiquity antenna and other hardware 
    - meshbot is working! Posting events and reminders (maybe network status)
1. Central Org (dasanchez)
    - Do we want to bring back virtual meshes? No clear decision
1. Website (garry)
    - deployed the map!
    - pending: how to ping nodes
    - redesign look & feel in progress with hank
    - pending issues about project page, but did automate pulling in content directly from github
    - mirror on DAT/beaker
1. Outreach (dasanchez, Pedro)
    - Met with Tony Bolla, St. Clair BIA, could connect to Kensington BIA
    - W. Queen West BIA--connection through adam
    - Freegeek: Meeting space at Parkdale--connection through dcwalk
    - Makerfestival
    - Outreach Poster is ready to print, publish link
    - Nov 29: UofT Decentralized Tech Association talk (all welcome)
1. Deployment (Pedro)
    - Possible locations keep growing (40+ locations), existing relationship with Rodgers
1. Node tech (Udit)
    - Discussed above

## Future Directions

### Partnerships

Which partnerships do we want to pursue?
1. FreeGeek, dasanchez happy to coordinate (dcwalk to put in touch), consensed to go ahead for new year
    - dcwalk will continue facilitating access to Semaphore Lab as needed
1. Toronto Public Library (Reference) - they have requested a demo of a number of nodes or a mesh that we can use as a working example.
    - **Toronto Public Library (Fort York)** - interest in workshop (6 weeks tops), more like a formalized course with a curriculum. Look to metamesh for existing documentation. benhylau will drive efforts to create syllabus and plan course out.
1. Campus Co-ops (Tristan), consensed to go ahead with a proposal
    - meet needs of members (reliable network!), ~10/people 3devices/person
    - testing antennas outdoor year-round?
    - hybrid service, non-cjdns protocols?
    - a range of possible collaborations, first steps attending a board meeting, a proposal to work toward a cooperation agreement      
1. Kensington/St. Claire BIA - consensed on revisiting at our next planning session once we have a more mature (i.e. tested) hardware/software stack
    - metamesh model is more in line with what BIAs are looking for
    - time commitment is more than what volunteers can give
  
### tomesh Model Discussion

- How to address requests from parties asking for a mesh installation (BIAs for example)
- Creating a separate group with a different model will be discussed at a later time

### Deployment

- We are not at the stage where our tech is reliable for large-scale deployment, need to test first
- Orange Pi hardware: How to build one properly? Heat issues have been addressed/mitigated in prototype  
- What are the immediate next steps?
  - 5 GHz mesh test deployment at Toronto Reference Library
  - Continued refinements to monitoring, hardware, and software

### Roadmap

**Key milestones**

1. Fort York Library Outreach **2018 APR**
    - Course curriculum development (benhylau)
1. 5GHz mesh @ Makerfest **2018 JUL** (darkdrgn2k will lead)
    - **December Test Date TBA** multiple node, wireless-only network test
    - Risks:
    	- have to purchase nodes
    	- hardware unknowns
    - Getting started now:
    	- number of nodes available
	- set dates for testing/next stages
1. Campus Co-op Partnership
	- Project proposal (dcwalk and sindark)
	- **December delivery**
