# Notes
- Many new attendees! Restructured agenda to make more time for discussion

## Problem Definition: Key Issue & Problem For
- Worked through comments and notes from our brainstorming docs, key themes in our discussion:
    - resiliency, sustainable communities
    - 'democratizing' potential (in quotes)
    - 'awareness' as not always the right frame to understand invisibility
    - technology literacy
- Reframe our language when choosing a key issue (and consider whether some could be collapsed together): _"problematize..."_ or _"lack of..."_
- Our brainstormed goals of who this is a problem for, or who could be initial interested groups to reach out to, could be expanded to include:
    - students
    - shared internet with roommates and in multi-unit places
- Proposal that we consider adopting an "emergent problem definition"

## Roadmap
A few events that had been brought up as potential anchors for us to establish goals around were:
- Under Gardiner Community Meeting _April 7_  [undergardiner.com](http://www.undergardiner.com/)
    - Project in early stages, decided to wait on future chances to connect

- Open Source Circular Economy Days, Host local event _June 9-13_  [oscedays.org](https://oscedays.org/)
    - no strong interest in participation

- Maker Festival _July 9-10_  [makerfestival.ca](http://makerfestival.ca/)
    - definite interest
    - potential to run hands on workshops/activities

- HOPE, NYC _July 22-24_  [hopeconf.wordpress.com](https://hopeconf.wordpress.com/)
    - definite interest
    - potential to connect to other mesh projects
    - potential to set as a goal for technical reference implementation

# Outcomes
- Decided to hold a longer planning meeting (3hrs), not during Civic Tech TO's night
    - Poll for meeting time will be put on the `#torontomesh` channel
    - Will be selected prior to next Tuesday (April 12) and announced at Civic Tech TO
