# Notes

- Did a round of intros!
- General problem of working with volunteered geographic information
- Nice descriptors from the intro this week:
    - "distributed ownership"
    - "passing packets to your neighbours around the city"

- Deployment options
    - NYC 'request a node' form
    - Work with anchor organizations

- Maybe we have a way to have people fill out a form saying they are interested for Maker Festival, hey we'll do this together!
- Long term way of thinking of a game or engaging activity that could happen on the mesh
    - Projects like Access Now
    - Interface to HAM radio


## Update on Prototyping

- Last week four tomesh people spent time at Bahen centre prototyping the current hardware setup, work toward makerfest event deployment
- Four nodes covered all of Bahen Centre!
- Unencrypted network, so not ideal, but closer to our end goal!

## Update on Outreach Meeting

- Recapped the outreach meeting outcomes and next steps
- Meeting on Thursday June 2, 2016 at 6:30pm:
    - [Toronto Mesh Documents repo](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents)
    - [Materials Design Resource](https://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/18-objectives/)

- Potential for Lighthouse Labs to provide free space! Should consider for event space

## Infrastructure: Rocket.Chat & WeKan Deployment

- Currently also IRC on freenode #tomesh; Slack: Toronto Mesh
- Over the next week Kanban and Rocket.Chat will have test deployment
    - Working from scripts and documentation provided
- From a resiliency (through isolation) and security perspective it makes sense to atomize services

## Makerfest Satellite Event Next Steps

- Will identify and work with material that already exists
- Set up a time to brainstorm concepts and identify which material already covers the topics
- Would this (brainstorm for satellite event) work for the Civic Day of Hacking on June 4, 2016

## Raspberry Pi 2 Debugging

- Specific issues with the compile failing on raspberry pi 2
