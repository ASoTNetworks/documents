## Future Directions
**What should a Toronto Mesh Node actually do?**  
We have some outstanding development to work on before a deployment model can be outlined. 

Work areas:
1. Incentivized mesh
2. Single-board + p2p apps
3. Testbed infrastructure (monitoring + management interface)
4. Long term deployment at partners' sites
5. Workshop
6. Website
7. LibreRouter antenna 

Which partnerships do we want to pursue? Are we ready to approach potential partners yet?
- Free Geek + HackLab: focus on long-term testing a priority
- Toronto Public Library: they want us back, we will work on the next version of the workshop
- Campus Co-op: they are open to providing access, we can leverage that for further testing
