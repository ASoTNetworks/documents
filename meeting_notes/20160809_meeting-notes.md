# Notes

## tomesh Progress Report (Status Today & 6-months)

Technology

- Script to run on Raspberry Pi and automatically run cjdns
- No long-range meshing validation
- Difficult to commit to long-term vision due to project's decentralized nature
- Meshing not just over WiFi but virtual mesh over IP to start
- Prototyping decentralized ISP model
- Detailed status and timeline from Planning Meeting notes
- Current status on Wekan

## Next Steps with Free-Net Collaboration

- Explored tomesh as a Free-Net project vs. community organization (unincorporated association) with particular initiatives sponsored by Free-Net
- tomesh to start as community organization and avoid management overhead, until it becomes necessary to explore other options
- Will explore CIRA grants through Free-Net
- FreeGeek also gets money through a charitable organization
- Voted to have Free-Net apply for grant for sponsoring [Validate ISP model on the mesh](https://wekan.tomesh.net/b/LWS8X7sGFXqDgZ7ag/tomesh-net/XjDPETsLFaFoD3Eq6) and how it integrates with Free-Net backhaul
- Free-Net gets the grant money, give almost all of it to tomesh

## Update from Non-tech Group

- Formed through CivicTechTO project lab
- Sister project to tomesh
- Had a meeting with group this week
- Pilot project at Orton park
- Pitch it as an education project
- Context of the project:

	- Engage the community about networks
	- tomesh as a technical platform

- Looking at different tools
- Ethan brought up an interesting UI [starfishdcs.com](http://starfishdcs.com)
- Working title: **Toronto Community Network**
- Continue with user research in Orton Park
- Ben raised that tomesh may be more appropriate at Scadding Court
- Still figuring out scope

## Slides on Tremor WiFi Solution & Deployment

- Went through a deck on a commercial solution that installs mesh networks for clients such as Wireless ISPs
- The clients sell to end users, the commercial solution just builds the infrastructure and does integration
- Discussed their deployment model and topology:

	- Placement of wired and wireless links
	- Access to Internet gateways
	- In-building meshing
	- Bandwidth management with RADIUS servers to prevent in-mesh bandwidth being used up by a single node
	- Completely distributed nodes vs. some level of central management

## Build A Node Workshop

- 5-min intro to mesh
- 5-min intro to tech platform

- Ideas:
	
	- IRC over cjdns
	- Vector over cjdns
	- Wekan over cjdns

- "Promise to plug this free Pi in to your home network" (form the beginning of our virtual mesh)
- Ethan to record event

## General Discussions (not everyone was involved)

- Want Github workshop run by CivicTechTO (source control can be considered basic literacy)
- Website content needs to be very high priority:

	- Start with existing general pitch document by Ethan
	- Ideally have expectations with associated dates
	- This should sufficiently address issues with **where to find resources** and **how to get involved**
