0. Intros
1. Outreach, Contributing, Mesh.101
2. Upcoming Breakout Meetings

# Notes

- Conversation on societal implications of mesh after prototyping
- NYCMesh as a "mature mesh" reference point (this is a really great example to illustrate a living mesh, especially the map visual)
- How can people bypass Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and still get content? (with regards the motivation of creating a mesh)?
- Discussion of possible locations for deployment in Toronto
- Disaster scenarios: how to power computing/mesh devices (nodes and clients)
- Server space to host Kanban board and Rocket.Chat still needs to be resolved
    - DigitalOcean is an option

## Outreach, Contributing, Mesh.101

- Question: how do we onboard someone, especially if they don't have any prior knowledge about us, or if they don't know anything about a mesh?
- We spoke to changing understanding around outreach -- a key question of "why are you interested"
    - Mix of people: who are interested and have previous mesh knowledge versus those who don't have any experience
- Some supporting resources for people who are interested in learning more?
    - One-page intros or more in-depth?
    - Self-led versus in-person workshops?
- How do we adjust to our current capacity and future potential
- Figure out a way for how people feel like their interests can fit into future tomesh!
