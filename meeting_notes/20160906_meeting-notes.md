## IPFS, CJDNS

  - Also similar to git w/r/t distributed files
  - CJDNS
  - End-to-end encryption is baked into the implementation
  - Hyperboria
    - Services are running in a private network

## Feasibility of local Ethereum networks (Mesh ISP)
  - 32gb default SD card size
  - Parity (Rust Ethereum is 4-8 times faster)
  - Ethereum well funded enterprise implementation

## Deployment
  - "Hockey puck" nodes that is self sustaining with 1km range
  - Mesh network friendly defaults as part of the flashed image
  - Create image from a script deployment (hook from Pi prototype)
  - Open question: How to maintain/update nodes remotely such as [resin.io](https://resin.io)

## Android mesh nodes
  - Self contained, with battery, and has the benefit of a screen/UI
  - At the moment, Pi node with regular AP will be needed to join the CJDNS

## Personal level ISP (trusted peers)
  - Pay via Ethereum token system
  - Reference: [Althea](http://altheamesh.com/)
  - Build organic networks
  - People interested in networks: something that can be done with neighbours
  - Mesh as a way to do local price comparison
  - Run events to promote network awareness
  - Build services for local needs through collaboration and awareness of tech
