_What will participants get to do at your event? What style of event is it? What should they bring? What kinds of people would it interest? Is it for beginners? Is there something at your event (a process/technology/technique) that might need a little explaining?_

Join Toronto Mesh for a three hour intro to networks workshop! Through hands-on activities and play we will cover basics of:
    - how networks like the internet operate
    - features and quirks specific to the internet
    - alternate forms of networks (like mesh networks) that people can use to connect with each other!

Absolutely no experience or prior knowledge required. All you need is enthusiasm and curiosity! This is a beginner, family-friendly workshop. Toronto Mesh will be setting up a mesh network (tomesh.mini) at the Maker Festival, so come here if you want to find out more about what this 'mesh' will look like!
