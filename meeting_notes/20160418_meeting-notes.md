# Notes

- We will use voting in this meeting:
    - _Thumbs up_: go ahead, care about the issue and happy with direction
    - _Closed fist_: "no-block"
    - _Thumbs down_: needs more discussion, feel strongly enough to block

## Intros

- Went around and everyone gave a brief intro
    - If people would like to add in their name for the meeting minutes they were asked to add it to the Meeting Agenda Pad
- Got at status update, our current approach has been two-pronged:
    - Developing vision and establishing a direction for the project
    - Prototyping hardware
- Wanting an open process, documenting as we go, to make information available for people looking up details and wanting to participate
- Think about preliminary outreach to other Mesh organizations (Seattle, NYC, Detroit)

## Vision

- Discussion Looked at the [Brainstorming Gdoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XQiqvkuFiTmaVtZcjmwBUfH5cwZdaYYLXHPqWAB1sB0/edit)
- Original framing "Internet infrastructure = invisible": Agency, Autonomy, Tech literacy
- _Internet infrastructure is invisible to most of its users, resulting in end users not having:_
    - For some users: internet is a utility
    - Some will see infrastructure as a barrier of entry
    - Root problem: People are inclined to not understand how the internet works
    - How to make avenues for understanding, and approaching infrastructure
- Question: Are we going for something completely _transparent_?
    - Show something that is not legally binding, friendly safe
    - Accountability: Make clear known risks
    - Ref: Sao Paulo air quality network and resident participation
    - **Possible frame of "How we operate"** or "How do we build a sustainable community"
        - POV: like to know packet journey; what is being tracked, where is data going?
    - What we are building: no centeralized ISP
- New theme: _resiliency_, redundancy, de-centeralized systems over single points of failure. Negative attributes: latency, potentially
    - **Resilience, and redundancy also an issue we are interested in (Voted)**
    - Use case: catastrophes, Blackout scenarios
    - Alternative to a HAM radio network
    - Solar power alternatives
- _High speed access_: **Are people are most interested in free public access (Voted)**
    - **Vote: Main concern is not access (Voted)**
    - Not the first consideration, but that doesn't mean are they mutually exclusive
    - Ref: [Toronto Star "What became of Torontoâ€™s push for free public Wi-Fi?"](http://www.thestar.com/business/tech_news/2016/04/17/what-became-of-torontos-push-for-free-public-wi-fi.html)
        - Paid for by BIA (in most cases, downtown London)
        - Montreal: Not for profit wireless group, part funded by the city
        - Involve City Council
        - Wireless Toronto: Funding is possible (needs more investigating)
    - Is this project mutually exclusive with providing high speed access? **No!**
        - The mesh can hook into an established, provided for (BIA), infrastructure
- Reference to [Network Types Diagram](http://networkcultures.org/unlikeus/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/03/networktypes.png) by [Paul Baran](http://www.rand.org/about/history/baran.html)
- *Provide access to high-speed Internet*
    - Are we providing the tools to start a network? or access to an existing network?
    - Original intent: Mesh net is available, anyone is able to access (access to the internet), and look at the process (and source code) or how we've gotten access
    - Internet as utility
        - Cost, infrastructure: Mesh would help in costs
        - High speed is not guaranteed, mesh networks not the right intervention to Internet as a utility (Governance is a better way)
    - Long-term goal is high speed through the mesh (is changing)
        - Professional hardware is more available to consumers
        - BIA, City issue: centralized decision-making
- Aside: Communication scenario where there is no power using something like VOIP
    - To what degree is some central piece needed?
    - Layer on top of pre-existing infrastructure can exist side-by-side
    - Solar charged batteries (self sustaining)
- We can't have a completely free mesh net (electrical, shared paid infrastructure, solar panels)
- After a lot of discussion we circled back to access. **Decided access is #1**, with everything as a sub-point, **settled on a vision! (Voted)**
- _Possible vision statement_: Advancing mesh technology...
- _Possible vision statement_: We're going to build a network that provides access to the internet as well as affords people autonomy

### Vision Statement

> We are going to build an infrastructure that gives users:
> - agency to make important decisions about their privacy
> - autonomy to access information in an uncontrolled/free manner
> - opportunity to develop technical literacies
> - a resilient and redundant network
> - open, lower-cost access to the World Wide Web

> ...In order to address the fact that Internet infrastructure is a black-box to most of its users.

## Roadmap

- Potential events: last week we looked at Maker Festival (TPL, proposal booth), HOPE: outreach and other projects
- _Maker Festival_:
    - Workshop, booth: place to chat, voice calls over the mesh
    - Way to build engagement: interactive (gamify), exhibit (interesting to look at)
        - Role-play (game to teach networking concepts)
            - _Ingrid Burringtons'_ workshop materials as reference
        - Exhibit ideas:
            - LEDs light up to show packet travel. Consider families interaction
            - Water flow diagram to show networking concepts
            - Cool app deployment (game, chat)
            - Trading zone (barter network, physical network via mesh network)
    - **Leading proposal writing and submission (April 30): Udit, Ben, Dawn**
    - **End of May**: Validation of tech (Prototype Developed)
    - **Mid-June**: Working version will be ready for deployment (Mesh Prototype Validated)
- _Website_:
    - Deadline for Maker Faire submission (needed for submission)
- _HOPE_:
    - Connect with _NYCMesh_
