# Notes

- We will use voting in this meeting: 
    - _Thumbs up_: go ahead, care about the issue and happy with direction
    - _Closed fist_: "no-block"
    - _Thumbs down_: needs more discussion, feel strongly enough to block

## Intros

- Went around and everyone gave a brief intro
    - If people would like to add in their name for the meeting minutes they were asked to add it to the Meeting Agenda Pad
- Status Update, current approach been two-pronged:
    - Vision and establishing a direction for the project
    - Prototyping hardware
- Want for an open process, documenting as we go, to be available for people looking up information
- Think about preliminary outreach to other Mesh organizations (Seattle, NYC, Detroit)

## Vision

- Looking at the [Brainstorming Gdoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XQiqvkuFiTmaVtZcjmwBUfH5cwZdaYYLXHPqWAB1sB0/edit)
- "Internet infrastructure = invisible": Agency, Autonomy, Tech literacy
- Resiliencly (new): In case something were to happen (e.g. Turkey site blocking)
    - Redudancy, decenteralized systems over single points of failure, Positive, negative attributes: latency, potentially
- *Internet iInfrastructure is invisible to most of its users, resulting in end users not having:*
    - End user: internet is a utility
    - Some will see infrastrcuture as a barrier of entry
    - Root problem: People are inclined to not understand how the internet works
        - Part of Reason: Large technical step
    - Self-selection bias
    - How to make avenues for understanding, and approaching infrastructure
- Q: Are we going for something completely transparent?
    - Show something that is not legally binding, friendly safe
    - Accountability: Known risks
    - How do we build a sustainable community
    - Ref: Sao Paulo air quality network
- *High speed access*
    - Not priority
    - Ref: [Toronto Star "What became of Torontoâ€™s push for free public Wi-Fi?"](http://www.thestar.com/business/tech_news/2016/04/17/what-became-of-torontos-push-for-free-public-wi-fi.html)
        - Paid for by BIA (in most cases, downtown London)
        - Possible matching funds
        - Montreal: Not for profit wireless group, part funded by the city
        - Involve City Council
        - Wireless Toronto: Funding is possible (needs more investigating)
        - **Are people are most interested in free public access (Voted)**
            - Not the main thing; Not the first consideration: Are they mutually exclusive
        - Free wireless [Network Types Diagram](http://www.rand.org/about/history/baran.html)
            - BIA could provide an uplink to the Internet
        - Is this project mutually exclusive? No
            - The mesh can hook into an established, provided for (BIA), infrastructure
        - **Vote: Main concern is not access (Voted)**
- **Vote: *Internet iInfrastructure is invisible to most of its users, resulting in end users not having:* (Voted)**
- **Vote: Resilience, and redundancy (Voted)**
    - Use case: catastrophe
    - Alternative to a HAM radio network
    - Blackout scenarios
    - Solar power alternatives
- *Transparency*
    - Possible frame it as "How we operate"
    - POV: like to know packet journey; what is being tracked, where is data going?
    - What we are building: no centeralized ISP
- *Have a sustainable community to maintain an engaged group* (Voted to delete)
    - Layer above technical implimentation
    - To be removed from problem definition
- *Provide access to high-speed Internet*
    - Are we providing the tools to start a network? or access to an existing network?
    - Original intent: Mesh net is avliable, anyone is able to access (access to the internet)
    - Source code access is 
    - **Covered in the previous points? (Voted)**
    - Is this a bi-product of the mesh?
        - Originally it is seen as a bi-product
    - Internet as utility
        - Cost, infrastructure: Mesh would help in costs
        - High speed is not guaranteed
            - Mesh networks is not the right intervention to Internet as a utility (Governance is a better way forward)
    - Purpose of Mesh:
        - Literacy of the network/tech
    - Long-term goal is high speed through the mesh (is changing)
        - Professional hardware is more available to consumers
        - BIA, City issue: centeralized decision-making
    - Moonshot: Highspeed internet
        - Goal
- Aside: Communication scenario of no power using something like VOIP (e.g. not streaming netflix)
    - HAM radio operators = Resilience
    - Some centeral piece is needed
    - Goal: free VOIP calls to people on the network
    - Layer on top of pre-existing infrastructure can exists side-by-side
    - Solar charged batteries (self sustaining)
- Access is #1. Everything else are sub-points
    - _Key issue_: Own the infrastructure
- _Possible vision statement_: Advancing mesh technology
- _Possible vision statement_: We're going to build a network that provides access to the internet as well as affords people automony
- We are going to build an infrastructure that gives users:
- Transitioned key issue (original doc structure to a vision statement. See doc)
- We can't have a completely free mesh net (electrical, shared paid infrastructure, solar panels)
- Black Box, compared to invisible (Black box)

### Vision Statment
> We are going to build an infrastructure that gives users:
> - agency to make important decisions about their privacy 
> - autonomy to access information in an uncontrolled/free manner
> - opportunity to develop technical literacies
> - a resilient and redundant network
> - open, lower-cost access to the World Wide Web

> ...In order to address the fact that Internet infrastructure is a black-box to most of its users.

## Roadmap
- Potential events: last week we looked at Maker Festival (TPL, proposal booth), HOPE: outreach and other projects
- Maker Festival:
    - Workshop, booth: place to chat, voice calls over the mesh
    - Way to build engagement: interactive (gamify), exhibit (interesting to look at)
        - Role-play (game to teach networking concepts)
        - Exhibit idea: LEDs light up to show packet travel. Consider families interaction
        - _Ingrid Burringtons'_ workshop materials as reference
        - Idea: Water flow diagram to show networking concepts
        - Idea: Cool app deployment (game, chat)
        - Idea: Trading zone (barter network, physical network via mesh network)
        - **Leading proposal writing and submission (April 30): Udit, Ben, Dawn**
        - **End of May**: Validation of tech (Prototype Developed)
        - **Mid-June**: Working version will be ready for deployment (Mesh Prototype Validated)
    - Mesh networks 101
- Website:
    - Possible Wordpress deployment / _Github_ pages
    - Deadline for Maker Faire submission (needed for submission)
- _HOPE_:
    - Connect with _NYCMesh_

## Working sub-groups:
- **Software**: Garry, Ben
- **Use Cases for the Mesh**: Udit, Ben, Garry
- **Hardware**: Ben, Udit, Dawn
