## Infrastructure: Rocket.Chat and Wekan Deployment

- Deployment issues on the VPS
  - Most likely Node version dependencies: Build script could be using an old version of Node
  - There's no Node version management on the server at the moment
  - Might opt for a manual build of Wekan
- Digital Ocean is the next choice for deploying Wekan and Rocket.Chat if there are continued issues
- Possible feature (post-deploy): A chat bot for Rocket.Chat
  - A bot that can parse chat and reference a source document or group subject matter
  - Google's Natural Language processing, [Syntaxnet](http://googleresearch.blogspot.ca/2016/05/announcing-syntaxnet-worlds-most.html)
  - Not known if it's a self-hosted service or a Google hosted API

## Pi 2 Prototype Update

- Demo of current implimentation with setup scripts from [repo](https://github.com/tomeshnet/prototype-cjdns-pi2) with CJDNS
- Hardware requirements for Maker Festival (so far):
  - Raspberry Pi 2: 6 (Already have 4)
  - TP-Link WN722N: 6 (Already have 6)
  - USB Power Adapters (Micro): 6
  - Webcams: 2â€“4
  - Webcams that are compatible with the Pi (Raspbian ready. We can look at the native Pi camera)
- Goals for June 6:
  - Confirm prototype implimentation on Pi 3
  - Get video link working with webcams
