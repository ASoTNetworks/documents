  <ul>
    <li>the need that a meshnet addresses is more obvious in a rural setting where users don't otherwise have access to networking
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>what does Toronto need that a meshnet can provide?
      <br>
    
      <ul>
        <li>???
          <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
    <li>Jon hopes that this could be a "blue-sky" reading group where we could cover things that we wouldn't in a workshop setting
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>Short stories could maybe have a place in future readings
      <br>
    </li>
  
    <li>"Book reports" so that not everyone has to read every article might also be worthwhile
      <br>
    
      <ul>
        <li>The person who chose each paper could be responsible for this
          <br>
        </li>
      
        <li>time always slips away from us, and 
          <em>reading is hard</em>
        
          <br>
        
          <ul>
            <li>low commitment in that even if you haven't read everything, you're still welcome
              <br>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  
    <li>Maybe we need a cap on the number of pages per reading?
      <br>
    
      <ul>
        <li>???

            <li>previously a heavily-polluted industrial town
              <br>
            </li>
          
            <li>Chattanooga wanted to lay fiber, Comcast was opposed because 
              <em>the government shouldn't compete with private industry</em>
            
              <br>
            </li>
          
            <li>In Toronto this is comparable to the situation with Bell/Rogers vs Wind, Teksavvy, etc.
              <br>
            </li>
          
            <li>They laid Fiber, and it's been great for the local economy
              <br>
            </li>
          
            <li>There is now a startup community drawn to the city
              <br>
            </li>
          
            <li>We're not laying down fiber, so we don't have that problem
              <br>
            </li>
          
            <li>Where can we deploy our infrastructure so that it serves the greatest number of users?
              <br>
            </li>
          
            <li>How do we deal with <em>entrenched interests</em>?
              <br>
            </li>
          
            <li>Maybe Toronto isn't the right location for this because of the high rent
              <br>
            </li>
          
            <li>Toronto has poor IPv6 adoption, so the capacity to host content from otherwise restricted networks is a potential benefit
              <br>
            
              <ul>
                <li>Especially with the offer of VPN setups where clients can be assigned a public IP address for home computers (as opposed to in a datacenter)
                  <br>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          
            <li>we may need to gather evidence and test deployments in a less restrictive environment before moving forward
