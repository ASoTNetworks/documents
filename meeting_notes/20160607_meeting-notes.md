## Infrastructure Update: Wekan  

- Board is up [wekan.tomesh.net](http://wekan.tomesh.net)
    - Current status: demoing, ssl needs to be deployed, rocket.chat
    - Integrations: rocket.chat is close; unsure about GitHub
    - ETA to live: next week
- Stretch goal of a knowledge management bot with Parsey McParseface / [Syntaxnet](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/tutorials/syntaxnet/index.html)

## Under Gardiner Update

- [Project Under Gardiner website](http://www.undergardiner.com/)
- Jon at the walkshop for the Under Gardiner, they indicated they are speaking with Beanfield to provide free wifi hotspot
    - Outreach lead is interested in connecting with us and seeing what could be related
- Do we fit into the 'local services' niche? Nodes that host 'local' content
- Related? Scadding Court has a lack of wifi, Victoria Hub pilot project for wifi at a spot
    - Revisit in July roadmap planning update
    - Jon will continue to keep tabs on these projects

## Outreach Update

- tomesh.101 folder structure, **VOTED** and consensus to adopt restructured repo:
    - `glossary`
    - `presentation-modules`
    - `reference-specification`
    - `tutorial`
- Knowledge management considerations:
    - Preference for linking to versioned content or commits (on a github repo for instance)
    - Referencing internet archive
- Tutorial draft demo'd
    - First draft, was tested by Yuri and feedback was gathered
    - "new, intermediate, advanced" levels for setup
- Research of existing mesh projects and educational materials to be collected: [pad.riseup.net/p/tomeshnet-meshresearch](https://pad.riseup.net/redirect#https%3A//pad.riseup.net/p/tomeshnet-meshresearch)

## Website

- Emphasize community ownership of network, a fact missing from the website currently **VOTED** and consensus to add to website:
    - Ben to send in PR to address

## Related Projects from Ethan

- Introduction into [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) project and potential fit into mesh
- Interest in raising standards of living without incurring additional financial cost to the government
    - Thinking about leasing out access opportunities that reduce cost?
    - Decentralized allocation and management of access?
- The [DAO fund](https://daohub.org/) has money for funding decentralized projects, [current proposals](https://dao.consider.it/)
    - How could tomesh fit in? Act as a reference example for implementation of a last mile (how this could be a decent model going forward)
    - Proposal would be an Ethereum contract, using a standard
    - Takes 0-5% return (could indicate which)
- Pay attention possibly to 'build the nation' projects from [Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/icgc.nsf/eng/home)
