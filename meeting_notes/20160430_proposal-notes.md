- @dcwalk: out two weeks in Jun
- gabby: won't be around in july for maker faire, but can contribute in advance

## Funding and Materials

- workshop: **~$50**
- resource/materials: **~$50**
- mesh deployment: **~$0-200**

### Sources

- civic tech slack for funding?
- other sources? (see above re. semaphore)
- screens: TRL, Free Geek?, hacklab.to junk day?

# Brainstorming Notes: Toronto Mesh Mini

- Setting up nodes at the venue
    - activity based? or gamified? in a rolling or ongoing manner
    - unique to the fact that it is a mesh! "why is it special"
    - Q: interacting with the mesh on their own devices?
- In the context of maker faire at TRL, mesh "terminals" of some sort might would be interesting, but wifi is going to be garbage
    - "barter network"... needs and yields with things made from the event.
    - voip app? "everyone a person behind a screen... but a way to connect with people behind the mesh"
    - tin-can network talking // walkie-talky // intercom network?
    - video chat
        - vs. voice only? make more visible that we are "using a network (internet)"... low bandwidth data applications?
    - terminal camera [p2pvc](https://github.com/mofarrell/p2pvc)? bandwidth issues might be a problem, but voice-only will be challenging due to the amount of noise
- visual/interactive component at the desk... education/hands on
    - water-encoded [water solenoid valve](https://www.adafruit.com/products/997)
    - multi-medium activity (e.g., start with hands, move onto something else...)
        - lo-fi? hand-sent messages "broken telephone", pipe cleaners?, yarn
        - hand switching
    - topics for activities:
        - transmission, addressing, routing/hops
        - 'packets,' encoding
        - 'topology,' node, links

# Draft Proposal

## Proposal Type

Installation or activity area

## Group Name

Toronto Mesh (tomesh.net)

## Project Title

tomesh.mini


## Project Description

_Be descriptive! Pretend you're explaining your project to someone who doesn't know anything about it. Provide some broader context for your project, and the key details that explain what will actually be at the Festival._

While the internet is now a critical part of our everyday lives, it is not always easy to understand how it works. As internet users, many of us lack the technical literacy required to make educated choices about internet-related issues that impact us. This has left most of us voiceless in decisions about how internet resources are publicly provisioned and regulated. Tackling these issues begins with generating a discussion about not only how the internet currently works, but how it can be made to work in the future. Recognizing this, the Toronto Mesh project is building a community-owned network, where infrastructure is owned by individuals and internet traffic is routed through participating neighbours, what is known as a "mesh network". Our goal is to promote technical literacy about networks in order to take control of our autonomy, privacy, and internet access through building a sustainable alternative to the current centralized infrastructure.  

At the Maker Festival, Toronto Mesh will:

- Deploy "tomesh.mini", a local mesh network in the Toronto Reference Library, and through interactive video chat, visually display how data can be routed through the network.
- Have a hands-on model explaining how mesh networks function. This interactive and playful station will encourage visitors of all ages and abilities to take part!
- Provide scaled-down learning materials that serve as an introduction to our satellite event, where we will conduct interactive group activities to communicate basic networking concepts (Semaphore Research Cluster members have held on designing mesh networks, network concepts and digital literacy).

## Describe your project BRIEFLY (50 words or less)

_this smaller description may be used on signage at the festival_

Join Toronto Mesh as we build a wireless community network. Learn how the internet and mesh technology works with tomesh.mini! See what's going on across the festival venue without the web. Visit us to interact with it and see a hands-on analogue to a mesh network.

_Ben's revision:_
Join Toronto Mesh as we build a wireless community network. Learn about how the internet and mesh technology works. Visit us to interact with "tomesh.mini", the local mesh we deployed across the venue, and see a hands-on analogue of information flow behind the scenes.

## Maker Festival thrives on interaction. What hands-on activity will you provide?

_this requires a breakdown of activities_

- We will deploy a local mesh "tomesh.mini" at the location and run a simple video chat on it. People will be able to use the locally deployed mesh to see what's going on at other nodes on the mesh.
- We will demonstrate how the internet currently works and contrast this with mesh networks. This will be done by means of a hands-on toy model of the internet. We will keep this playful and interactive for families to be able to participate. The idea is to improve technical literacy in an engaging way.

## Preferred Booth Location

Indoor

## Project Website

[tomesh.net](https://tomesh.net)

## Maker Information

_Who is our point of contact?_
Udit

## Logistical Details

### If your exhibit requires anything other than a 6-foot table, 2 chairs and power, please describe it.

_Include details of any extra equipment or space you might need. You MUST tell us if you plan to have anything that won't fit in the standard space, such as a large sign.  Give dimensions of things you plan to bring!_

We would like to place half a dozen mesh nodes spread across the venue. These are Raspberry Pi's with a small antenna, that preferably would sit on top of shelves or tied onto walls. They also need to be powered (comment: we could possibly power them with batteries too?) (batteries would get annihilated by two days of driving video - even if only ascii vid) (if we scout the TRL we can find appropriate mounts and bring extension cords as needed)

### Noise

- Normal - does not interfere with conversation
(our noise won't but we need to be mindful of how loud maker faire is)

### Electrical Req.s

- Electronic equipment (eg 3D printer)

### Internet Req.s

- My exhibit MUST have WiFi internet access to work right

### Are there any issue with your exhibit that might be related to Health & Safety?

- No

## Anything else we should know about your project?


## Have you exhibited (/spoken/presented) at any related event previously? Please tell us which ones, what years.

Members of the group have created and led workshops in which everyone co-designs a network (NodeRunner: [https://github.com/dcwalk/performingmesh](https://github.com/dcwalk/performingmesh)), using a range of modalities to visualize and map networks (Ways of Seeing: Visualizing Networks: [https://github.com/dcwalk/visualizingnetworks](https://github.com/dcwalk/visualizingnetworks)).

## Please upload pictures and files about your project
