### Discussing Reading Group

- chat is always on (we use matrix)
- this is our second reading group
  - the person who suggested each article will give a summary of it
  - however, ben and anastasia are not present, and they suggested articles

### Reading

#### Ansuz:  Winner "Do Artifacts Have Politics?"

- Common to just think of the technological side of tech without the ethics
- Designers often leave ethics to applications
- Eg: Nuclear - creates "techno-scientific elite"
- Main take-away: often removing ourselves from the politics of technology we free ourselves of any guilt
- Relation to mesh: initial assumptions -- attracts anarchist mindset due to decentralization. May actually attract people for various other political aspirations

- examples of politics emerging around technologies in use?:
  - Parkways in Long Island, blocking public transit to certain areas
  - Mechanical tomato picker. Lead to selecting certain type of tomato crops (denser). Bigger farms were selected over smaller
    - Sarah: parallels to machine-learning and technological displacement/unemployment
    - Tech systems often migrate from higher marginal costs to higher fixed cost systems
  - Sarah: ties to the zine article. "How do we create sustainable systems, that don't create top-down, techno-elite"  
  - ???: when building a mesh network, do we expect consolidation in the future?
    - ISPs controlling a lot of common infrastructure after the initial push for a decentralized governance model
  - why do corporations still exist today?
    - 'laundering trust' is costly
  - 'trying to pay attention to the momentum of large-scale systems'

#### Udit: [Roads and Bridges](https://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/)

- making open source projects sustainable
- why do open source systems fail?
- funding of software that most of the web (2/3s) uses (OpenSSL)
  - there are only enough funds to pay one employee
- money has a corrupting influence on open source software
  - 2002 linux kernel fights as proof of corrupting influence
- projects have difficulty dealing with the influence of corporate sponsors
- why is this relevant to mesh networking?
  - we want the infrastructure we build to be sustainable
- what is included under the umbrella of 'sustainability'
  - one view: 5 factors in sustainability
    1. individual
    2. environmental
    3. technical
    4. financial
    5. economic
- more people have become 'users' of open source in recent years
- technical literacy is the defining boundary in the asymmetry of power dynamics
  - inclusion in open source is 'gamified' by github
- stackoverflow content used to be under a Creative Commons license (which requires attribution), now it's under an MIT license
  - it's mostly corporations that worry about attribution
- LOL Leftpad

#### Sarah (volunteered): [How to Survive an Internet Apocalypse](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-to-survive-an-internet-apocalypse)

- set up a 'scavenger hunt' for information, where people have to move data from one point to another without using the internet
- unfortunately, lots of meshnet technology doesn't work when it's not an emergency because the existing infracture uses all available frequencies
- 'roleplaying in the city' (low tech) as opposed to VR games
  - 'anti-surveillance' games, creating routes through town that avoid surveillance cameras
- gamified mesh networking is more interesting than just working on infrastructure
- ??? details about Outernet (satellite relay networking)

#### Anastasia (not present): [Creating a trans-atlantic mesh network for flights](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b6ac/ec90ffb7c1d28e07697676bb29af25a55751.pdf)

- project loon (uses balloons)
- facebook uses drones
- elon musk wants to use satellites
- everybody's doing it (except us :-()

#### dcwalk: [Rebuilding Technology Zine](http://communitytechnology.github.io/files/downloads/ReBuildingTech-Zine2.pdf)

- first 10 pages were a recap of their philosophy/what they've learned
- 10 principles of open technology (we're not quite aligned with all of them)
  - community networks should be led and built by those they are intended to serve
    - our goals
      - open access
      - resilience
      - autonomy
      - ???
      - profit
    - small goals to help us on the way to the big goals
      - investigate various technologies
      - find a path between two permanent installations of mesh nodes where we can establish a connection over line of sight radio
      - deploy a small mesh network for the library
  - be careful of 'technology in search of a problem'

Next Steps
-----------

- Break in December, back end of January
- Check-in on schdeuling: Sundays seem to work, but should we adjust the timing?
  - people suggested earlier or later in the day
  - dcwalk will repoll for times (but keep to Sundays) in January
- Check-in on readings:
  - Including a case study seems nice, though maybe too many today?
  - Including philisophical / critical article also nice
  	- dcwalk all about that Winner
  - Suggestions that could provide a brief summary of the technical concepts in a reading/article when we suggest it
	- More inclusive
    - A way of building technical literacy (referenced Jan 14, day with hands-on workshops as another avenue)
- Suggestion that we might want a central primer / reading list of key articles
- Will arrange a mic/webcam for improved remote experience (sound and feedback were issues)
