## ReSet Communities

- TCHC (Toronto Community Housing) ReSet project
    - Orton Park as a possible area for a deployment
    - https://www.torontohousing.ca/capital-initiatives/capital-repairs/ReSet
    - Nahum on ReSet's goals: _"We need to renovate units, how can we run programs that can employ members"_
    - Aiming towards the development of "Trades Labour" and developing physical infrastructure
    - Opportunity to create/contribute to digital stewardship projects
    - WIP proposal and outline posted on Slack: Openn Google Doc [https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Vkj5D8viLZt9Ar98m2drWDSC5oL_a9uoqQphkCb7fs/edit]
    - TOMesh Demo Days in different neighborhoods and events, including the game
    - Consultation and identifying stakeholders is need to understand the possible challenges with a deploy deployment and feasibility
    - Up-cycle computer hardware if there is a need for personal or community terminals
    - Offering of DSL Service through Free-Net as backhaul with distributed bandwidth across a few nodes
    - Idea: Get in touch with Damien Fox of _Wireless Nomad_

## Prototype deployment ideas

- Idea: Shared business owned routers; distributed bandwidth for small businesses
- **Lee:** Deploy Maraki Mini's in Kensington
- Provide a cost effective means for businesses in a geographic location to share bandwidth
- Applicable for wireless Point-of-sales terminals
- Counter argument: People don't care about which company they subscribe to (People keep subscribing to major telco services for hands-off, out of mind internet access)
- Additional points as counter-arguments: Maintenance, up-keep, and ownership
- Scadding Court Community Centre
- Executive Director, Kevin Lee is looking for interesting initiatives and is generally open to project proposals
- Investigate business cases for a deployment as there might be friction (research inquiry)
- Jon, Leo, and Nahum looking to engage with Centre
- Seattle Mesh, NYC Mesh as case studies
- Doing a deploy without assistance
- Picking a site and trying out the prototype to start
- Using consumer hardware and software (Currently the case with Pis)

## User Research

- **Vidhi, Garry, and Nahum:** Really adamant about focussing efforts on user research in the next 6 months
- Picking a way of doing a pilot should be informed by user research
- Point of issue: Many assumptions being made about possible deployment scenarios so far
- **Vidhi:** Welcome Home TO Group was divided in two groups: 1) Research, 2) Web implementation

## Documentation and onboarding improvements

- **Leo:** No clear point of entry for someone who wants to contribute
- Onboarding through Wekan is no optimal
- Github repositories are not clear for first time viewers (can be improved)

## Misc

- **Garry:** Send out a Doodle to confirm a date for the planning meeting (Location TBD)
- Meeting location: **Lee** offered connecting with colleague in Free-Net building (Bay St & Wellesley St W, aprox)
- Planning meeting: Aiming for early August
