The panel will be 3-4 community members to talk about the projects they're working on, the approach we use, the relationships we're building, and what we're learning about along the way.

## `@e` update from Ottawa

- Recent conversations show interest in what TOmesh is doing
    - Questions raised about regulations that would be in play
    - What would the relationship with ISPs look like?
    - Looking at possibilities for remote community networks
- What would funding look like from specific sources?
- Point from `@e` that we should look at messaging and have a more clear explanation of a problem as well as uses as we move forward, this led into reviewing our vision statement.
  - Current [vision changes](https://github.com/tomeshnet/tomesh.net/blob/42168ffae2edea4b8cf8b6ce4325ff0003f4cec9/_includes/vision.md)
  - From conversation and consensus in voting, we have the current statement:

> The internet is currently not open and inclusive for all people. We are building a community-owned infrastructure that gives us:
  > - open, lower-cost **access** to the World Wide Web
  > - a **resilient** and redundant network
  > - **agency** to make important decisions about privacy
  > - **autonomy** to access information in a free manner
  > - an opportunity to develop **technical literacies**

## Action item for `@e` and `@benhylau`

- Put together a plan beginning of July that we can describe to external people about what a Toronto Mesh would look like
- Include an appropriate level of tech details and what those offer
- Describe the skill-building component of this and how the physical infrastructure building will serve as a learning lab
- Preliminary speaking point:
  * everyone gets same quality of access, open protocol on commodity hardware, open access, community built, promotes tech literacy, decentralized, aligns with interest of the user, resilient, redundant, secure, privacy-respecting, deploy in underserved or poorly areas in Canada.
  * One main goal: affordable internet access for everyone so they can realize their right to access the internet.
  * Regardless of economic conditions, everyone should have an equal right to internet access.
  * Another advantage: Not corporate owned: you don't need to give up personal information to a private coffee shop or agree to be tracked etc just to access internet.
  * Comment on Starbuck internet access terms and conditions
