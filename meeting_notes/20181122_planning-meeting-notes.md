    - Basically have to be licensed by CRTC no matter big or small
    - Legal roadblock
  - Balconies (condo board can tell you to take antenna off) vs. roofs (board approval + permit)
  - How willing are people to put an antenna (vs. higher price for an ethernet cable) to get Internet?
  - Wholesale + infra cost vs. Althea model (no phone calls, managing customers, etc.)

  - Tour in a condo in Toronto by a friend:
    - Require permit to enter roof
    - Some condos may want to bring in multiple providers into condo so there is competitive markets
    - Access to telecommunication room is a challenge, board needs to sign off
    - Beanfield runs along King, east to west
    - Equipment is simple and not costly
    - Can fish wire through to customer's apartment
    - Beanfield can provide fiber access to the building, you're responsible for taking the fiber and distributing
