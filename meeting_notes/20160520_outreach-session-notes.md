# Notes

## Session Goals



## What is Outreach?

After conversation we focused in on three areas for outreach:

1. Let people know what we are doing
  - (Potentially) identify use cases (on the website)
2. Provide ways for people to get involved
3. Actively create space for people to get involved
  - Through a code of conduct to create space and credibility

## Outreach Strategy

- **Clear contact information**
  - ways to find us next (civic tech slack; rocket.chat; github)
  - better linking between github content and website
- **Intro/reference materials**
  - glossary and terminology
  - audience:
    - those with a level of technical expertise and specific tech/hardware background are covered... _these are the people who have reached out_
    - new and interested but haven't reached out... _why not? we should get feedback_

- Examples:
  - visualizations (e.g. [NYC mesh map](https://nycmesh.net/map/))
  - produce distributable materials
    - e.g. other mesh organizations or people who care about the internet
    - allow others to reference and use our materials permissively!

## Action Items and Next Meeting

### Immediate Action Items

_For next meeting we will..._

1. Firm up announcements and events on website
2. Gather feedback
  - Identify participants
  - [Github](https://github.com/tomeshnet) and [Website](https://tomesh.net/) walkthrough
3. Update the glossary (adding terms and definitions to mesh.101 issue)

### Longer Term

- _June_ mesh101.v2
  - More modularized around topics
  - Annotated to stand on own as Resource
  - Accessible to introductory audience
- _July_ Meeting would be nice
  - Use cases developed
  - Reflect on the outreach efforts of the previous 2 months
