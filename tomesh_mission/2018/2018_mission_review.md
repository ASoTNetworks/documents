# Toronto Mesh Mission Statement: 2018 Review

## 1. Draft: Our Vision & Mission Statement

We recognize that the infrastructure and applications we use today can keep us from an open and unrestricted access to the Internet.

Many of the applications on our computers and phones are controlled by centralized services that may engage in surveillance practices, whether for profit or for social control.

Much of the infrastructure that we use to go online is managed by internet service providers that may censor, filter, or throttle data transfers. This same infrastructure is in many cases prone to disruptions due to natural disasters and malicious interference.

We have imagined a better future for our networks, and we are working to make it a reality.

We are adopting applications built on open, distributed systems that rely on peer-to-peer communication rather than centralized systems. These applications empower us to have better control over our personal data, our communications, and the content we create and share.

We are developing hardware solutions with open source technologies and mesh protocols that can be used to deploy community-owned networks, independent of Internet Service Providers. Community-owned networks can give us:

- open, lower-cost access to the World Wide Web
- a resilient and redundant network
- agency to make important decisions about privacy
- autonomy to access information in a free manner
- an opportunity to boost technical literacy

A community-owned network asks users to understand the technologies they use and to make decisions based on their community needs, rather than those of corporations. 

A community-owned network needs people. We organize community events and workshops not only because they nourish technical literacy and motivate people to build networks, but also because they raise awareness of issues surrounding net neutrality, privacy, and censorship.

This is our mission: to  
**Help communities create better networks that rely on open source and peer-to-peer technologies, while promoting digital literacy and personal privacy.**

---
Runners-up:

- empower communities to create better networks that rely on open source hardware, peer-to-peer technologies, and digital literacy.
- empower communities to create networks that rely on open source hardware, peer-to-peer technologies, and digital literacy.
- explore building networks using peer-to-peer technologies and open source hardware that empower communities and increase digital literacy.

**2. Increase community engagement and outreach through technical literacy programs (workshops)**  
+ dasanchez|makeworld|benhylau|darkdrgn2k|joeyxl|dcwalk

**3. Raise awareness around the impact of technology on society**  
+ dasanchez|benhylau|darkdrgn2k

**4. Build a community-owned and managed network (infrastructure development)**  
+ dasanchez|darkdrgn2k|joeyxl

**5. Remain a volunteer organization**  
+ dasanchez|benhylau

**6. Make our platform easy to reproduce**  
+ dasanchez|benhylau

**7. Act as a meta-org that encompasses several projects**  
+ dasanchez|benhylau|NicoPace
- makeworld (_maybe_ focus on smaller amount of projects)

## 1, 2
The most common theme was community engagement. Doing more outreach work will raise awareness of alternative infrastructure and applications, and also provide a technical literacy platform that Toronto (and our many friends around the world) can greatly benefit from.

## 3, 4
Nourishing the technical literacy of our communities will lead to a better understanding of how networks and technology impact society, and motivate people to develop their own networks.

## 5
Regarding governance, remaining a volunteer organization suits us fine still.

## 6
"Documentation and reproducible solutions" applies to both infrastructure/node development and workshop/outreach materials.

## 7 
Work on any given project is driven by the individual(s) interest in that field. Going back to #1, increasing the amount of people involved with Toronto Mesh will make more resources available for areas that need work.

## 3. Summarized Comments

### dasanchez

"continue raising awareness around community networks and decentralized applications [...] by reaching out to my friends and neighbours and running workshops at my local library."

"push for adoption of open technology and drive sensible legislation around Internet access and the services that it affords."

"My vision [...] involves communities taking control of their communication infrastructure and linking them up over time.

"remain volunteer-based"

"offer guidance to individuals and communities"

"push for hardware and software alternatives to closed and centralized platforms"

"spreading technical literacy"

"raising awareness around issues regarding access, agency, and autonomy"

"partner with third parties to create [deployments] that [are] fully individual/community-owned"

"document projects"

**Mission statement proposals**  
- Building tools to empower online access.
- Empowering communities through decentralization.
- Building alternatives to the centralized web.

### makeworld

"becoming a meta-org [...] we would [...] facilitate communication and synchronization of ideas between multiple groups"

"provide decentralized services in Toronto, bringing Web 3.0 to our city"
"include things like workshops, outreach, IPFS, Scuttlebutt, cryptocurrency, and of course, mesh networks."

"I don't think we have enough people to sustain multiple initiatives"

"(I want) to see something happen, mostly mesh deployment with offline-first, decentralized apps"

"I'd prefer something more focused, what has to be debated is what we'd lose in doing that."

**Mission Statement Proposals**  
- Empowering communities through decentralization.

### benhylau

"I am building decentralized off-internet networks, and literacy materials to make such systems accessible to a broad audience."

"create a space for people interested in various aspects of offline networks to learn and collaborate"
"support other initiatives related to alternative connectivities"

"Toronto Mesh should not be a legal entity and remains open-membership"
"help groups with shared visions establish their own self-agent entities to work toward the objectives of their membership"

"continue to require little effort to maintain by volunteers who each contribute a little"
"(make the) "tomesh stack" easily replicated by another group trying to launch a mesh local"
"members aligned on pursuing a common goal can operate independently as a small group to move things along quickly"

"continue being an active participant to the global movement around community networks, distributed systems, connectivity freedom, and information accessibility."

### NicoPace

"the organization has multiple personalities, it tries to hard to be together, with very different purposes, perspectives and projects."

"Toronto might benefit from having a proper Community Network (owned, managed, expanded, supported by its community of users)."

"Toronto might benefit from having a decentralized technologies hackerspace, where ideas can be explored and successful ones can be polished for everyone to benefit."

"ToMesh can be the umbrella to these possibilities."

### darkdrgn2k

"I would love to see Toronto Mesh become a community network and work on the infrastructure of it."

"Through outreach and education it can help be a solution to this core issue (people and relationships). Working on things like the P2P workshop and and outreach like our Mesh Picnic we can reach out to people to join the cause."

"expand my knowledge of distributed systems, and how they interact with society."

### joeyxl

"big corporations and monopolies should not be the only ones allowed to use the airspace and be the only ones with infastructure hardware."

"have a network where secure and safe communcations as well as "off the grid" networks can flourish and grow."

"more PTP links"

"a final decision on what hardware to use for meshing"

"see the community grow"

"Build a mesh network with it either being a small local area in a house"

"Share and educate peeple about tomesh and engage them with live demos and what they need to get setup."

"Discuss with fellow members in the group and collaborate on current solutions we use and how we can make them better."

"Want to have a a digital connection with the community and use 100% FOSS software and hardware as much as possible."

### dcwalk

"create alternatives (maybe not total replacements or feature-for-feature swaps) to existing patterns of infrastructure, ownership (and the exclusion that goes with them)."

"_pretend you are bigger than you are_ and folks will think you are a movement that you might eventually grow into."

"(think) about demystifying technologies and be inviting for those not usually included and interested"

"I want Toronto Mesh to be the name around which a functioning (network) is created in Toronto."

"I wonder if taking up more mature software and hardware that can work in parallel (with cjdns and librerouter) would be one way to focus on that."

**Mission statement proposals**  
- Toronto Mesh is prototyping the next generation of the internet
- Toronto Mesh empowers people to create better networks, relying on peer-to-peer and mesh technologies, digital literacy, and open hardware
- Toronto Mesh is imagining better network futures
