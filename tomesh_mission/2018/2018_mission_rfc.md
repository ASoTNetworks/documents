**My motivation**

I joined Toronto Mesh after I figured net neutrality was going away in the US, thinking this project meant doing away with ISP-controlled access, but this remains a long-term goal.
After a short while, I realized that infrastructure is not everything- the applications riding on the copper/fibre/airwaves play a big part in how much control we have online.
I think Toronto Mesh is able to foster change on both infrastructure and online services.

I did not join the group looking to be part of a startup or to find out novel ways to sell internet access. Instead, I want to continue raising awareness around community networks and decentralized applications. I can do so by reaching out to my friends and neighbours and running workshops at my local library. It is through education that we can push for adoption of open technology and drive sensible legislation around Internet access and the services that it affords.

I need to have some confidence in the technology and my know-how before approaching my neighbours to see who is interested in creating a local mesh. As soon as the LibreRouter ~production units start shipping I will buy a couple to test. The Raspberry Pi is a great tool for development, but I think we need something slightly more robust for long-term use. Ideally, I wouldn't spend any more time fixing my node than I do resetting and updating the firmware on my router...ideally.

My vision - not for Toronto Mesh but for how I access the Internet - involves communities taking control of their communication infrastructure and linking them up over time. Today, a local mesh network could help me share files with a neighbour two blocks over, but it will not help me get in touch with friends and family living hundreds of kilometres away. In the future, the long distance links could be provided by ISPs, community-owned networks, or even a combination of the two.

**What I want from Toronto Mesh**

I want Toronto Mesh to:
-  remain volunteer-based,
-  offer guidance to individuals and communities looking for technical assistance,
- continue pushing for hardware and software alternatives to closed and centralized platforms,
- continue spreading technical literacy,
- continue raising awareness around issues regarding access, agency, and autonomy,
- partner with third parties to create a reference deployment that is fully individual/community-owned (thinking LibreRouter), and
- document all current projects for those looking to us for leadership (and we are doing fairly well).

I don't want Toronto Mesh to serve as a WISP, but I am OK with it working together with people starting their own WISPs.

**Mission statement proposals**

1. Building tools to empower online access.
2. Empowering communities through decentralization.
3. Building alternatives to the centralized web.
4. We are building a wireless network *community* in Toronto ;)

**My Motivation**

I joined tomesh because I had been learning more and more about Web 3.0 and decentralization, but wanted to finally do something. I wanted to get involved in my community, and helping build a mesh network seemed like a project that would fit really well with my interests and what I had been learning before.

**What I want from Toronto Mesh**

There was a lot of talk in the Funding matrix channel about tomesh becoming a meta-org, where we just act as a gathering place for projects and even orgs that align with our goals. One of those projects may be mesh deployment, another may be a general funding org, whose whole purpose is to generate revenue and manage money for the other projects. In this way tomesh becomes the Toronto Network Commons, or something similar. As a meta-org, we would help out these projects and groups, and facilitate communication and synchronization of ideas between them. This is a bit unwieldy as a vision statement though, and so beyond the meta-org, I'd like to see tomesh provide decentralized services in Toronto, bringing Web 3.0 to our city. This can include things like workshops, outreach, IPFS, Scuttlebutt, cryptocurrency, and of course, mesh networks.

Tomesh might be too small to become a meta-org. From what I've seen in this group, there is a lot of experimentation and proof-of-concept and messing around with tech that happens, which is important and fun, but hinders us from reaching a specific goal. We don't have one clear goal, probably because there are many different opinions within the group about what should or can be done, and so we fall back to experimenting and each person for the most part doing their own thing. Ideally, we become a meta-org so each person can explore their own interests and opinions, but realistically I don't think we have enough people to sustain multiple initiatives, and so we would fall back to what happens now. And what happens now is great, but there isn't a solid goal being reached, and a big part of me really wants to see something happen, mostly mesh deployment with offline-first, decentralized apps. This would be something with many fronts: legal, software, hardware, financial, design, outreach/education, marketing, etc -- and that's why it's so hard to pull off, especially when there are differing ideas. The solution is not to pick one specific goal that most people end up being unhappy with of course, but I think it would be nice to have a general goal like the one I mentioned above, and the details can be figured out over time.

With that said, if our goals are much more relaxed, that what we've been doing now is great, with demonstrable progress with prototype-cjdns-pi, all the demos we did at the mesh picnic, the workshop, etc. But I'd prefer something more focused, what has to be debated is what we'd lose in doing that.

**Mission Statement Proposals**

To be honest I like a lot of dasanchez's proposals above, they capture a general idea without being specific to one thing, or complicating things by mentioning a meta-org. My favourite of his is #2.

**My Motivation**

I enjoy building things with peers who have shared values and visions, and sharing these experiences with broad audiences. Currently, I am building decentralized off-internet networks, and literacy materials to make such systems accessible to a broad audience.

**What I want from Toronto Mesh**

I hope that Toronto Mesh can create a space for people interested in various aspects of offline networks to learn and collaborate, as well as support other initiatives related to alternative connectivities. Some examples include: community networks that are connected or disconnected to the internet, distributing ownership of the applications we use, literacy initiatives accessible to audiences of different backgrounds.

Organizationally, I believe Toronto Mesh should not be a legal entity and remains open-membership (unless an individual is in violate of Code of Conduct). It can hold tools and resources that help groups with shared visions establish their own self-agent entities to work toward the objectives of their membership. As more of these organizations in solidarity spawn, and hopefully contribute back to the commons under the Toronto Mesh title, the decentralized entity that is called Toronto Mesh will acquire resilience such that it is not solely dependent on one legal entity, which often have a governance structure that reflects the decisions of its membership at a particular time. Basically, it's very hard for an organization to be sustainable over long periods, especially a volunteer-based and open-membership organization. As it scales it will accumulate bureaucracies and points of centralization, so if we imagine Toronto Mesh to be a lasting aggregate of resources in the commons, we should keep it light. I would like Toronto Mesh to stay "low-overhead to operate" for three reasons:

- So it can continue to require little effort to maintain by volunteers who each contribute a little
- So the "tomesh stack" can easily be replicated by another group trying to launch a mesh local
- So members aligned on pursuing a common goal can operate independently as a small group to move things along quickly without much bureaucracies, for example to acquire funding to specific project plans that its membership can personally commit to

I hope Toronto Mesh to continue being an active participant to the global movement around community networks, distributed systems, connectivity freedom, and information accessibility.

**My Motivation**

I am more an outside observer than a member of Toronto Mesh, so my comments will come from a very narrow but uncommon point of view within Toronto Mesh.

I started following Toronto Mesh activities I think through github interactions around Mesh Networks with Ben.

The things I recognize as valuable within the Toronto Mesh community are the diversity of members and the technical proficiency of them. Of course there are many more, but these are the most clear to me.

I keep following Toronto Mesh because of the approach it has of making things easier to its members/users, something that we share from AlterMundi, and because I like the tinkerer approach you have to problem solving.

**What I want from Toronto Mesh**

One of the things I have said many times to many members of Toronto Mesh (with all the respect and recognition that I have to you and your process) is that I feel the organization has multiple personalities, it tries to hard to be together, with very different purposes, perspectives and projects.

For me, ToMesh today feels liks a Hackerspace, where lots of projects are being run in parallel by different enthusiasts, but there is no one main project being run with everyone in it.

I think this is a perfectly viable option for the collective in this moment, and as it grows it will find its own way through its contradictions.

I believe that Toronto might benefit from having a proper Community Network (owned, managed, expanded, supported by its community of users).

I believe that Toronto might benefit from having a decentralized technologies hackerspace, where ideas can be explored and successful ones can be polished for everyone to benefit.

I believe ToMesh can be the umbrella to these possibilities.

**My Motivation**

I found tomesh looking for a mesh network in Toronto, I thought it would be an awesome thing to have a community network in a city like Toronto. I quickly learned about the scope and the complexity of the distributed web movement on more than just the network level.

**What I want from Toronto Mesh**

I would love to see Toronto Mesh become a  community network and work on the infrastructure of it. I think it would be an awesome accomplishement to have such a thing in Toronto.   I understand that depoloyment in an urban environment is full of challenges that must be overcome that could be solved in time with the right motivation and resources.

I think one of the core challanges the mesh network is not technology but people and relationships. Through outreach and education it can help be a solution to this core issue. Working on things like the P2P workshop and and outreach like our Mesh Picnic we can reach out to people to join the cause.

I hope to expand my knowledge of distributed systems, and how they interact with society. I hope to continue to contribute to the projects as they come up learning from others and sharing my knowledge.

In the end I'm not sure what Toronto Mesh will become, but with good people and the right motivation I think it can do great things for not just Toronto but the rest of the world.

### joeyxl

**My Motivation**

i joined tomesh when i accidently found the site and read what it was and what it is all about, i got very intrested in the project and what it could potentally become. big corporations and monopolies should not be the only ones allowed to use the airspace and be the only ones with infastructure hardware. having mesh links setup can have a network where secure and safe communcations as well as "off the grid" networks can flourish and grow. i also am learning programming languages, so that i can use them to benefit projects such as tomesh.

**What i Want from tomesh**

the one thing that needs to happen is more PTP links, and a final decision on what hardware to use for meshing. it seems to be an issue when getting the right SBC/wireless adapter/power supply. finding everything that fits our needs, and mabye even mabye 1 or 2 things would make it alot more consistant and easier to deploy and maintain the network. i also want to see the community grow, as this will bring more to the network, and maybe even allow for the first peramanant PTP links.

**Mission Statements**

1. Build a mesh network with it either being a small local area in a house, or a PTP link between 2 places.
2. Share and educate peeple about tomesh and engage them with live demos and what they need to get setup.
3. Discuss with fellow members in the group and collaborate on current solutions we use and how we can make them better.
4. Want to have a a digital connection with the community and use 100% FOSS software and hardware as much as possible.
