üìÖ Monday, February 4  

| Timezone | Workshop | General  |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| PST      |`07:00 am`|`08:00 am`|
| EST      |`10:00 am`|`11:00 am`|
| CEST     |`04:00 pm`|`05:00 pm`|
| HKT      |`10:00 pm`|`11:00 pm`|

## What is this?

Biweekly standing open-call for remote parties to sync up on topics of mutual interest. The hours are selected to make it possible for parties of different timezones to attend.

Anyone may propose a topic on [this open-edit pad](https://hackmd.io/HSOK15u7TnS6Oz1RH0McGg), taking one of six timeslots by putting yourself as _Facilitator_ and filling the corresponding [_Agenda_](#Agenda) section.

The _Course_ hour is for topics relating to the [Building the Peer-to-Peer Internet workshop series](https://tomeshnet.github.io/p2p-internet-workshop/), such as discussing about workshop facilitation at a new location, the logistics of getting the hardware and software set up, funding opportunities for curriculum development, etc.

The _General_ hour is for all other issues, such as [Prototype](https://github.com/tomeshnet/prototype-cjdns-pi) or [Mesh Orange](https://github.com/tomeshnet/mesh-orange) updates, IPFS live streaming discussions, showcasing your new project, or collective brainstorming of collaboration opportunities with Toronto Mesh.

Lastly, please scope your session within a 20 minute time block. If more time is needed, it is probably best to use the 20 minutes to give an overview then schedule separate meetings with interested parties. The hope is that these standing hours can be well attended and everyone participating gets a general idea of the things going on :satellite:

## Meeting notes

### Communications load balancing for Toronto Mesh (out-of-band)

- Ben: Shifting communication tasks towards other people, now Ben is a central point of many relationships Toronto Mesh has with external parties (this has been discussed at roadmap meeting)
- DarkDrgn2k: Having an organization be the point of contact instead of a person makes it easier to shift communication from person to person
- Ben: Inbound is via `hello@` and that seems to work fine, but the connections that result from "marketing activities" (e.g. presenting at conferences, workshopping with groups) lead to a lot of centralized connections
- Hank: Perhaps this is an email probelm, people are getting replies from a personal account and now they contact that person instead of the org?
- Ben: Mesh Sync actually seems like a good place to do load balancing for communications, it gives external people more folks to talk to, and we can do a round of having people volunteer to become point contact for each relationship
- Tim: The follow up with people should be documented in the pad for each call

### DX call & workshop slide updates

- Hank: Design Exchange was asking about getting people to present parts
- Hank: Workshop overhaul is almost done! Will require help getting the build script working
    - Ben to take care of script
- Pam: People's Open is looking into having workshops to onboard and teach new people
- [People's Open](https://peoplesopen.net/) will have a **Build your Own Internet** Workshop end of March (TBD)
- Looking into incorporating LibreRouter as a hardware module
- Create a more interactive experience, may partner with a local design group called [DynamicLand](https://dynamicland.org/)
- Inspired by Bret Victor and visual communication as interface in communicating concepts. [The Humane Representation of Thought](http://worrydream.com/#!/TheHumaneRepresentationOfThought/note.html)
- New education budget will also create stickers, brochures and community outreach material. Inclusion and diversity is important for the group and they want to invite participation. The goal is to train and educate future facilitators of different neighborhoods. Oakland is rich with diversity
- Mapping: Working on creating a 3d map/topography of the network to vizualize the nodes on the city scale
- Maybe it's helpful to visualize the "stack" of a mesh, from the physical to application layer... In architecture we have the foundation, structural, skin systems... that is visualized in layers
- Ben: Perhaps the workshop should be reworked to include these things as other modules?

### Amber Initiative and People's Open

- Ben: Loomio +1 (re: People's Open starting to use Loomio)
- Pam: 

    - Developing governance processes to allocate 100k Handshake grant to grow the project and increase sustainability.
    - Education is a top priority for Peoples Open ~at least 10% of budget
    - Reliability is another priority
    - Recently partnered with the Internet Archive to install a [5Ghz Ubiquity Air Fiber](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1239021-REG/ubiquiti_networks_af_5u_us_af_5u_airfiber_high_band_5.html/?ap=y&gclid=CjwKCAiA4t_iBRApEiwAn-vt-4c7v4mxJUxjxeHtw8sVP-1E3coR5nSHbEPehURjV80EDXli16Z6hhoCEckQAvD_BwE&lsft=BI%3A514&smp=Y) In Richmond,CA. 12 miles north of Oakland

- Ben: +1 on LibreRouter for workshop
- Ben: Open to reworking [P2P Internet Workshop](https://tomeshnet.github.io/p2p-internet-workshop/)  and rebranding it as a collaborative effort with other mesh communities:
    - More modular content
    - More traditional mesh content (e.g. perhaps having LibreRouter as base hardware, this will also help engage existing communities behind LibreRouter)
    - People's Open has a "station" model, what they planned at Our Networks 2018
