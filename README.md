## Collaborating on Kanban

The Toronto Mesh uses a [Kanban (看板)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) to keep track of ideas and their progress. The software we use is the self-hosted open-source [Wekan](https://github.com/wekan/wekan). Anyone is free to create an account and participate.

### Usage

To see the current status of the Toronto Mesh project, visit the [publicly viewable Kanban](https://wekan.tomesh.net/b/LWS8X7sGFXqDgZ7ag/tomesh-net).

You can contribute to the project in many ways. Start by [creating an account](https://wekan.tomesh.net) for our Kanban, and then ask on Slack or email [hello@tomesh.net](mailto:hello@tomesh.net) for an invite to our main Board.

#### Propose an Idea

* Create a new Card in the **Ideas** column by adding a short title
* Include details in the Description
* Add appropriate Labels for easy filtering

#### Participate in Discussion

* You can add a Comment to an existing Card, regardless of what column the Card is in
* Visit [tomesh.net](https://tomesh.net) and find other chat channels to discuss

#### Work on a Card

* Find a Card you would like to take ownership and add yourself as a Member to that Card
* Move the Card to the **In Progress** column, or **Discuss** column if that needs to happen first for the particular Card
* When completed, move the Card to the **Done** column (a task that leads to a Pull Request in our [Github repositories](https://github.com/tomeshnet/) is usually considered done when reviewed and merged)
