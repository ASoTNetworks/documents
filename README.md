# Documents

This is the repository where our meeting minutes and other important documents and planning notes live.

## Project Vision

We are going to build an infrastructure that gives users:

- **agency** to make important decisions about their privacy
- **autonomy** to access information in an uncontrolled/free manner
- opportunity to develop **technical literacies**
- a **resilient** and redundant network
- open, lower-cost **access** to the World Wide Web

...In order to address the fact that Internet infrastructure is a black-box to most of its users.

## Getting Involved

We are still in the early stages and would love involvement from more people! Please be in touch by:
* emailing us at [hello@tomesh.net](mailto:hello@tomesh.net)
* speaking with us on the `#tomesh` channel in [CivicTechTO](http://civictech.ca/)'s slack ([get an invite](https://civictechto-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/))
* joining us at our weekly [CivicTechTO Hacknight](http://www.meetup.com/Civic-Tech-Toronto/)

## Collaborating on Kanban

The Toronto Mesh uses a [Kanban (看板)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) to keep track of ideas and their progress. The software we use is the self-hosted open-source [Wekan](https://github.com/wekan/wekan). Anyone is free to create an account and participate.

### Usage

You can contribute to the Toronto Mesh project in many ways. To see our current status, visit the [publicly viewable Kanban](https://wekan.tomesh.net/b/LWS8X7sGFXqDgZ7ag/tomesh-net). If you would like to join the project, start by [creating an account](https://wekan.tomesh.net), and then ask on Slack or email [hello@tomesh.net](mailto:hello@tomesh.net) for an invite to our main Board.

#### Propose an Idea

* Create a new Card in the **Ideas** column by adding a short title
* Include details in the Description
* Add appropriate Labels for easy filtering

#### Participate in Discussion

* You can add a Comment to an existing Card, regardless of what column the Card is in
* Visit [tomesh.net](https://tomesh.net) and find other chat channels to discuss

#### Work on a Card

* Find a Card you would like to take ownership and add yourself as a Member to that Card
* Move the Card to the **In Progress** column, or **Discuss** column if that needs to happen first for the particular Card
* When completed, move the Card to the **Done** column (a task that leads to a Pull Request in our [Github repositories](https://github.com/tomeshnet/) is usually considered done when reviewed and merged)
